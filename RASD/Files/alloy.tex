In this Alloy section we focused mainly on the two most critical point of S\&C: the opening and closing of an internship position and the application by a student to an open position.
At the end there are also some screenshot from the Alloy analyzer that proved our predicates to be consistent or say that assertion may be valid since no counterexample were found (which is equivalent to say that the assertions made were fine since Alloy does bounded verification). 
In order to improve the readability of the Alloy part we decided to divide the code into different sections, namely Signatures, Internship Positions, Applications and Feedback and Universities.
