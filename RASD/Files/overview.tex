    \subsubsection{State Diagrams}
        The most crucial aspect of the application is the creation and evolution of the internship positions on the platform. Not to leave any room for doubts, we explain both the point of view of the company and the one of the student.
        \\
        A company can close an internship position whenever it wants to. Once it closes the internship, the applications who were accepted but not confirmed or not refused, the pending applications, and the applications needing an further assessments are automatically rejected. Instead, for those who confirmed, we consider the moment of the closing of the open position by the company as the moment in which they start their internship.
