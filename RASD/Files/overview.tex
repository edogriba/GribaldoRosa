    \subsubsection{State Diagrams}
        The most crucial aspect of the application is the creation and evolution of the internship positions and internships on the platform. Not to leave any room for doubts, we explain the point of view of the company and the one of the student.
        \\
        A company can close an internship position whenever it wants to. Once it closes the internship position, the applications who were accepted but not confirmed or not refused, the pending applications, and the applications needing further assessment are automatically rejected. Instead, for those who confirmed, we consider the moment of the closing of the internship position by the company as the moment from which the internship starts.
