\section{Architectural Design}
\subsection{Overview}
We chose the three tier architecture for S\&C. We believe that it is a solid choice aligned with our goals and requirements. \\
The architecture is divided in three:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\textbf{Presentation Tier} \\
    This is essentially the user interface
    \item\textbf{ Application Tier} \\
    This layer is where the data are transformed and undergo a set of processes to make them available to the user interface
    \item\textbf{Data Tier} \\
    This layer is where the data are stored and managed remotely.
\end{enumerate}
